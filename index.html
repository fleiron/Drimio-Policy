  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: June 24, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Drimio: Tarot & Dream Guide</strong> (the "App"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not collect personally identifiable information</strong> (such as name, email, or phone number). All data you optionally enter (such as dreams or tarot interactions) is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.</p>
  <p>We may collect <strong>anonymized technical data</strong> for subscription and basic analytics purposes, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App version and device model</li>
    <li>In-app purchase and subscription events (via RevenueCat)</li>
    <li>Basic usage metrics (e.g. number of tarot readings)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>The App offers premium content and one-time purchases via in-app transactions. Payments are securely processed by Apple. We do not collect or store any payment information ourselves.</p>
  <p>Subscription status is managed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, which may use anonymized device identifiers to validate subscriptions and prevent fraud.</p>

  <h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>At this time, the App does not use push notifications.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take data security seriously. As all content is stored locally on your device, and no personal information is transmitted, privacy risks are minimized.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any personal data with third parties. Limited anonymized subscription data may be processed by RevenueCat solely to enable and support in-app purchases.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime via your Apple ID account settings.</p>

  <h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is not intended for children under 13 years of age and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Entertainment Purpose Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>This App is intended <strong>for entertainment purposes only</strong>. It is not a medical, psychological, or therapeutic tool. Content related to tarot, dreams, or personal insights should not be taken as professional advice. For any serious concerns, always consult a qualified expert.</p>
